# Real-Time Object Measurement Project

## Overview

This project implements a real-time object measurement system using OpenCV and a webcam. The system captures live video feed, detects contours, and measures objects in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using contours
- Adjustable parameters for contour detection
- Measurement of objects based on pixel dimensions

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-object-measurement.git
    cd real-time-object-measurement
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install opencv-python numpy
    ```

## Usage

Run the following command to start the real-time object measurement:
```sh
python object_measurement.py
